<b>Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard</b><br/>
For the Python for Data Science project, I had to assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job was to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data, I had to visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks worked with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
<b>SQL Operations on Real-world datasets</b><br/>
